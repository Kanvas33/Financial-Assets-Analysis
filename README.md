# Financial Assets Performance Analysis

## Apple(AAPL), NVIDIA(NVDA), Amazon(AMZN), Tesla(TSLA), and Bitcoin(BTC-USD).

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **analysis** of various **financial assets**, including **stocks** **(Apple, NVIDIA, Amazon, Tesla) and Bitcoin**. The analysis covers the period **from 01/01/2020(Stocks)** and **from 01/01/2014(Bitcoin)**  up to the present date of this project, providing **insights** into **price movements, statistical analysis, and future predictions**. The project utilizes popular **Python** libraries such as **yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, datetime, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn**, and more to gather, analyze, and visualize data.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Collect historical price data for Apple, NVIDIA, Amazon, and Tesla (stocks) from 01/01/2020, and for Bitcoin from 01/01/2014 up to the current date of this proejct using the yfinance library.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis on the collected data, including calculating **mean daily returns, volatility, annualized mean return, annualized volatility, and constructing a correlation matrix** to understand the relationships between assets.

- **Bitcoin Analysis**: Focus on Bitcoin, including the calculation of the 200-Day and 50-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), building a Linear Regression model to make predictions until 01/01/2028, and estimating future price predictions with standard deviation.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Collection**:

Utilize the yfinance library to fetch historical price data for the selected assets.
Organize and preprocess the data using pandas and datetime.

- **Statistical Analysis**:

Calculate mean daily returns and volatility for each asset.
Annualize the mean return and volatility.
Create a correlation matrix to assess the relationships between assets.

- **Bitcoin Analysis**:

For the analysis of Bitcoin, **historical price data** has been **collected** starting **from 01/01/2014** up to the current date of this project. This extended historical data is used to make more accurate and informed **predictions** for Bitcoin's **future price movements until 01/01/2028**.

The bitcoin analysis includes the following key components:

Calculation of the **200-Day and 50-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** for Bitcoin.
Development of a **Linear Regression model** to predict Bitcoin's price trends until 01/01/2028.
Estimation of future **price predictions** for Bitcoin, considering **standard deviation** and **historical data**.

By utilizing an extended dataset, this analysis aims to provide more reliable **insights into Bitcoin's future performance and trends**, which can be valuable for investors and enthusiasts interested in the cryptocurrency market.


- **Visualization**:

Utilize matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to create informative visualizations of the data and results.

## Achievements and Insights

**Identification of trends and patterns in the price movements of Apple, NVIDIA, Amazon, Tesla, and Bitcoin**.
Quantification of risk and return through **statistical analysis, aiding in investment decision-making**.
Predictive modeling for Bitcoin, allowing for future **price predictions and risk assessment**.

## Conclusion

In **conclusion**, this project provides a thorough **analysis of financial assets**, ranging from **traditional** stocks to the **cryptocurrency** Bitcoin. It equips investors and analysts with valuable **insights** into **historical performance**, **risk assessment**, and **future predictions**. The combination of **Python libraries, statistical methods, and machine learning** models makes this analysis a powerful tool for financial **decision-making**.
